        <h2>Religious and Political Orientations as Predictors of Moral Judgments</h2>
        <p>Religion and politics are closely related, both historically and in the current heated political climate of the US.  This research examines how identification with political parties and religious groups shapes moral judgments including attitudes towards economic inequality, definitions of marriage and family, and other current social issues.</p>
        <h2>Spirituality and Positive Affect</h2>
        <p>Spiritual faith has often been associated with physical and psychological well-being. However, considering the multidimensional nature of spirituality, it is unclear which components contribute to positive outcomes.  This research investigates which particular components of spirituality shape positive affect.</p>
        <h2>Social Emotions</h2>
        <p>Social emotions serve the vital function of binding individuals into relationships and communities.  This line of research focuses on the experience as well as the neural correlates of emotions including embarrassment, compassion, and forgiveness.</p>
